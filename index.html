<u><b>WATER STAGNATION</b></u><br><br>

Water stagnation occurs when water stops flowing.When this happens it can <br>become an environmental hazard.
Too much standing water that isn’t draining<br> can damage flooring and foundations, as well as creating a perfect breeding <br>ground for mosquitoes that are known to carry very harmful diseases.<br><br><br><br>

<u><b>THE DANGERS OF STAGNANT WATER</b></u><br><br>
Stagnant water attracts rodents and insects.<br> As it soaks into a building’s structure, it damages wood, drywall and concrete.<br> The odor spreads from floor to ceiling.<br>
Stagnant water also hosts dangerous microbial pathogens.<br>
i) Bacteria including salmonella, staphylococcus and E. coli<br>
ii) Viruses such as Norwalk virus, hepatitis E. and rotavirus<br>
iii) Parasites such as cryptosporidium, E. histolytica and giardia<br>
iv) Unhealthy mycotoxins released by toxic black mold fungus</p>

<u><b>WHAT IS ACCIDENT?</b></u><br><br>
An unfortunate incident that happens unexpectedly and unintentionally,<br> typically resulting in damage or injury.
<br><br><br>

<u><b>WHY DO ACCIDENTS OCCUR?</b></u><br><br>
Most of the fatal accidents occur due to over speeding. ...<br> Faster vehicles are more prone to accident <br>than the slower one and
the severity of accident will also be more<br> in case of faster the severity of accident will also be more in case of faster vehicles.<br>
Higher the speed, greater the risk.
<br><br><br>
<u><b>HOW TO PREVENT FROM ACCIDENTS?</b></u><br><br>


1.Develop the right attitude about driving. Many teen auto accidents<br> are a result of attitude and maturity, not skills or knowledge. Make a <br>commitment to yourself to practice a responsible attitude about driving. You're<br>controlling over 3,000 pounds of fast-moving metal, and you owe it to<br> yourself, your passengers and other drivers to drive responsibly.<br><br>
2.Get as much supervised practice driving as possible. Your parents <br>should take an active role in your practice driving. Make a firm schedule with<br> them and stick to it. And keep it up until you take your test to get a license. Many<br> states now have graduated licensing laws. To learn about the laws in your state visit <br>the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety.<br><br>
3.ALWAYS wear your safety belt. Get into the habit of wearing a safety<br> belt whenever you are in a car, whether as a driver or a passenger - no exceptions.<br>

<u><b>WHAT IS TRANSPORTATION?</b></u><br><br>
The movement of goods and persons from place to place and the various means <br>by which such movement is accomplished. The growth of the ability—and the need—to<br> transport large quantities of goods or numbers of people over long distances at high <br>speeds in comfort and safety has been an index of civilization and in particular of<br> technological progress.<br><br><br><br>


<u><b>Various Modes of Transport Offered by Transport Companies:</b></u><br><br>
1. Road Transport- It is the most preferred and offered mode of transport by transport <br>agents and companies especially for short distance shipping.<br> 2. Rail Transport – This is the second most preferred mode due to its large carrying capacity. <br>3. Air Transport – The fastest means of transport to ship goods to distant places.<br> 4. Water Transport – This one is least preferred due to its slow speed but a very low-cost<br> means of transport for both long and short distance.<br><br><br>


<u><b>Benefits of Availing Transportation Services from Transport Agents:</b></u><br><br>
In Madhapur, Hyderabad transport agents hold immense experience and<br> have a team that can efficiently take care of all the transportation services required.<br> However, following are some benefits of hiring an agent or a goods carrier <br>in Hyderabad: Loading and unloading facilities. Management by team <br>of expert professionals. Doorstep delivery services. Quality, on time, and<br> trustworthy transport services. Continuous updates and/or tracking of the <br>transported goods. Transparent billing system. Good customer service.

<u><b>Survey On Educational Institutions In Madhapur:</b></u><br><br>
The Institutional Areas designation acknowledges the important role of the City’s institutions and their contribution to community-based initiatives.<br><br>

The Institutional Zone category permits uses associated with the Institutional Areas designation in the Official Plan.<br><br>

The City recognizes the opportunities and services provided by our institutional partners by further identifying Institutional Areas which form a concentration of Education, <br>Health and Research activity.<br><br>

However, because of their differing roles, purposes, and relationships with regard to charter schools and the Commission and the small sample size, data collected<br> from these stakeholders are not specifically called out in the summary analyses in this report.
